The ChipCode Programming Language
=================================

ChipCode is a compiled, bytecode interpreted strong functional programming language. The syntax was designed relatively close to C to provide a "C" style vibe to it and also a virtual machine for potability.

The whole point of this project is to not only create a functioning compiler but to teach how compilers work in the simplest way possible.

The bytecodes are very similar to Java. In the future I may write a transpiler to convert it to JVM bytecodes.
