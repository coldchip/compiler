# The ChipCode Programming Language

```ChipCode is a compiled, bytecode interpreted strong functional programming language. The syntax was built relatively close to C to provide a "C" style feel to it and also a virtual machine for potability.```

```The bytecodes are very similar to Java. In the future I may write a transpiler to convert it to JVM bytecodes. ```
